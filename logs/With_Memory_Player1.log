Hand: [Great Ball, Great Ball, Shauna, Potion]. Active: Blitzle (Full HP, attached [Lightning Energy]). Bench: Shinx (Full HP, attached [Lightning Energy]). Action this turn: After using the energy attachment, now opting to use Blitzle's attack against Player2's Active Larvesta.
Used energy attachment from hand. Remaining hand unchanged: [Great Ball, Great Ball, Shauna, Potion]. Current board and planned attack noted for future reference.

[Board state: "Player1: Active - Shinx (HP status not modified by attack yet), Bench - Blitzle; Prize cards remaining: 4.

[Drawn card: bug catcher]

[Last decisions: I decide to attack with Blitzle, using its available Lightning attack against Larvesta. This should deal damage and pressure Player2's Active. After the attack, I will end my turn.]

[User note: Your blitzle was damaged by 10 from your opponent's last attack. You used your attack zap kick and delt 20 damamge to your enemy's larvesta.]

Shinx's attack was used this turn. No cards were played from hand, so the hand remains intact as [Great Ball, Shauna, Bug Catcher].

[Board state: "Player1: Active Pok\u00e9mon - Shinx (Full HP with 30 damage, attached energies: [Lightning]); Benched Pok\u00e9mon - Blitzle (10 damage, attached energies: [Lightning]), Luxio (Full HP); Prize Cards remaining: 4. Player2: Active Pok\u00e9mon - Sizzlipede (Full HP, now with [Basic Fire Energy] attached after our move); Benched Pok\u00e9mon - Vulpix (Full HP, attached energies: [Basic Fire Energy]), Larvesta (80 HP, 30 damage, attached energies: [Basic Fire Energy, Extra Fire Energy, Basic Fire Energy, Basic Fire Energy]), Centiskorch (Full HP, no attached energies); Prize Cards remaining: 4."]

[Drawn card: luxray]

[Last decisions: Use Shinx's attack on Sizzlipede. I will target Sizzlipede with the assumption that my attack (costing 1 Lightning energy) will deal significant damage. This move is chosen to pressure the opponent's active Pokémon and potentially set it up for a knockout in upcoming turns.]

Optionally include:
  • "to_memorize": "<any extra details you think are important to remember>"
  • "user_input_request": "<exactly what you need me to do>"

Your "memory" field must at minimum summarize:
  1. Your current hand (removing cards you used).
  2. Your Active Pokémon and its stats (HP, attached Energies, any Conditions).
  3. Your Benched Pokémon and their stats.
  4. The specific action you are taking this turn.

You must only play cards that are currently in your hand—do not reference or use any other cards.

Then continue with your move.
