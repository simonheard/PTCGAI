[Drawn card: sizzlipede]

[Last decisions: I reexamine my options before attacking and see that my drawn Basic F Energy can be attached to my active Centiskorch to help power up its more devastating attack. I attach the drawn Basic F Energy to Centiskorch. Now Centiskorch has three energies attached – a Lightning Energy, and two Basic F Energies. With this configuration, I have the required energy to use my stronger attack, Heat Blast, which costs 2 Fire Energies and 1 Common Energy and deals 100 damage. I decide to use Heat Blast rather than the lower-damage option. I declare Heat Blast and target Player1’s active Shinx (which currently has 0 damage). The 100 damage from Heat Blast is more than enough to knock out Shinx. As a result, Player1’s Shinx is Knocked Out, and I take 1 Prize Card for the knockout. Player1 now must promote a new Active Pokémon from their Bench. (For the purposes of this simulation, we’ll assume Player1 chooses the first benched Pokémon – Blitzle with a Lightning Energy attached – to become their new Active Pokémon.) With that, my attack is complete and I end my turn.]

  "decisions": "I start my turn by reviewing my hand and options. I\u2019ve drawn a Sizzlipede, a Basic Pok\u00e9mon, which I can play onto my bench to bolster my board. I decide to bench Sizzlipede, taking advantage of the open slot beside Volcarona. With that done, I look at my active Centiskorch. It currently has 50 damage and one Fire Energy attached. Centiskorch has two attack options \u2013 the lower-cost Steady Firebreathing for 30 damage (requiring 1 Fire Energy) and the stronger Heat Blast for 100 damage (which would require 2 Fire Energies and 1 additional common energy). Since I only have the one Fire Energy on Centiskorch right now, I can only use Steady Firebreathing. Given that Player1\u2019s active luxio already has 70 damage, a well-timed 30-damage hit should push it over its HP and knock it out (assuming luxio\u2019s threshold is 100 HP, as previous scenarios hinted).\n\nI therefore declare the attack Steady Firebreathing from my active Centiskorch, targeting Player1\u2019s active luxio. The 30 damage increases luxio\u2019s total damage from 70 to 100, and luxio is Knocked Out. I then take one Prize Card for the knockout. As luxio is Knocked Out, Player1 must promote one of their Benched Pok\u00e9mon to the Active position. For the sake of this simulation, let\u2019s assume Player1 opts for the first Benched Pok\u00e9mon, Shinx, to become their new active Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nWith my Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s attack finished, I end my turn.",
