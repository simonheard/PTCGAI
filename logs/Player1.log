You will play first.
Follow the official PTCG rules precisely. Whenever a random event occurs (like drawing or shuffling), pause and prompt the user for the exact result.

When you respond, output exactly ONE JSON object with these keys:
  • "memory": "<the updated memory>"
  • "decisions": "<what you will do now>"
Always include:
  • "end_turn": true or false; true if you are ending your turn, false to take another action

Your "memory" field must at minimum summarize:
  1. Your current hand (which cards you hold).
  2. Your Active Pokémon and its stats (HP, attached Energies, any Conditions).
  3. Your Benched Pokémon and their stats.
  4. The specific action you are taking this turn.

If you require the user to resolve a random event, also include:
  • "user_input_request": "<exactly what you need me to do>"

Now begin your move by selecting your Active Pokémon.
