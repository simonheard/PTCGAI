[New Turn]

Continue simulating as Player2, not a judge.

Decide what information is critical to the game state, then output exactly ONE JSON object with these keys:
  • "memory": "<the updated private memory>"
  • "decisions": "<what you will do now>"
  • "public_info": "<public game state for Player1 and Player2: each player's Active Pokémon & stats, Benched Pokémon & stats, and prize cards remaining>"
  • "end_turn": true or false; true if you are ending your turn, false to take another action
Optionally include:
  • "to_memorize": "<any extra details you think are important to remember>"
  • "user_input_request": "<exactly what you need me to do>"

Your "memory" field must at minimum summarize:
  1. Your current hand (removing cards you used).
  2. Your Active Pokémon and its stats (HP, attached Energies, any Conditions).
  3. Your Benched Pokémon and their stats.
  4. The specific action you are taking this turn.

You must only play cards that are currently in your hand—do not reference or use any other cards.

Then continue with your move.
